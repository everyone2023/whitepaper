## 乌鲁木齐大火 Fire in Urumqi, Xinjiang

11月24日晚，封控了近4个月的新疆乌鲁木齐天山区吉祥苑小区内一栋高层住宅楼发生火灾，大火持续烧了近三个小时。

根据中共官媒央视新闻发布的情况通报，这场火灾是疑因插线板着火引发，最终导致10人死亡，9人受伤。

但一些流传的视频显示，消防车到达小区后，被疫情防控围栏困住，无法进入现场，只能从小区外面远远地往火灾处喷水，但因距离太远根本喷不到。

小区居民拍摄的视频则显示，楼里的通道门被锁死，导致他们无法逃生。

当局在情况通报里则表示该小区为“低风险区，居民可以下楼活动”。

On the evening of November 24, a fire broke out in a high-rise residential building in Jixiangyuan Community, Tianshan District, Urumqi, Xinjiang, which has been sealed off for nearly four months. The fire lasted for nearly three hours.

According to a briefing released by the Chinese Communist Party’s official media, CCTV News, the fire was suspected to have been caused by a fire on a power strip, which eventually resulted in 10 deaths and nine injuries.

However, some circulating videos show that after the fire truck arrived at the community, it was trapped by the epidemic prevention and control fence and could not enter the scene.

The video taken by the residents of the community showed that the passage door in the building was locked, making it impossible for them to escape.

In the briefing, the authorities stated that the community is a "low-risk area, and residents can go downstairs for activities."
